# Study-Planner
This project aims to create study planner for students. It will allow students to plan their schedules and later view it in an intuitive graphical user interface.  There are also plans to scrape websites with classes to automatically populate the planner using web scraping. Also, we can create a room timetable as well for the Geomatikum.
